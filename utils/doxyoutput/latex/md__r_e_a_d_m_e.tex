Here are a few changes to the grammar or language specification that have been made in the course of writing the parser. We can always rework these later.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Semicolons are now used to end statements
\item {\ttfamily $^\wedge$} is used for exponentiation, and {\ttfamily $\sim$} is used instead for bitwise xor.

Some (hopefully) helpful notes\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The array member operator (e.\+g. {\ttfamily array\mbox{[}2\mbox{]}}) is treated as \char`\"{}\mbox{[}$\,$\mbox{]}\char`\"{} in the symbol table.
\item {\ttfamily Arg\+Types} has been deprecated in favor of Args with a {\ttfamily NULL} value for {\ttfamily name}
\item Nested functions are supported, and can be returned by the enclosing function (functions are first-\/class objects). Variables defined in enclosing functions are resolved through closures. Clang\textquotesingle{}s way of doing this for C can be found \href{https://mapping-high-level-constructs-to-llvm-ir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced-constructs/lambda-functions.html}{\texttt{ here}}, and Nim\textquotesingle{}s method is found \href{https://nim-lang.org/docs/intern.html\#code-generation-for-closures}{\texttt{ here}}. These methods can be made easier by using \href{https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html\#trampoline-intrinsics}{\texttt{ LLVM trampoline intrinsics}}.

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item By tomorrow night (April 26th) -\/ Have {\ttfamily handle\+\_\+x} function definitions for all rules in our bison ({\ttfamily parser.\+y}) file.
\item By this weekend (April 29th-\/ish) -\/ Have bodies for {\ttfamily handle\+\_\+x} functions completed and creating nodes with syntax\+\_\+tree.\+c For each rule\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If necessary, add a struct and tag to the {\ttfamily struct Node} in {\ttfamily syntax\+\_\+tree.\+h}, and optionally add a helper function to {\ttfamily syntax\+\_\+tree.\+c} for creating a node of this type. See examples in the files. Note that not everything actually needs a node in the syntax tree, for example see the {\ttfamily handle\+\_\+custom\+\_\+type} function in {\ttfamily handlers.\+c}
\item Populate the handler function in {\ttfamily handlers.\+c} with code for creating the node.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item By the end of classes (May 4th) -\/ Have syntax tree working and able to generate a complete representation of our program
\item By the end of study days (May 8th) -\/ Have intermediate code generation to pseudo-\/code completed
\item Consult with Aviram regarding our work so far and what he wants in regards to additional functionality
\item From start of exams until May 15 -\/ Work on Aviram\textquotesingle{}s requirements, create testing script, add additional features, data structures, etc.
\item Done!

\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsubsection{Syntax / Grammar}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item More types, esp. tuples, lists, probably some sort of aggregate like a struct
\item Function declarations with generic types (this might be a little ambitious for type checking so maybe wait on this)
\item Probably various other things I\textquotesingle{}m forgetting about
\item Possibly add anonymous functions via \char`\"{}lambda\char`\"{} or similar keyword
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsubsection{Lexer}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add more literals such as float literals, specifying int literals by octal/hexadecimal, array literals, etc.
\item Improve string processing (current implementation is untested as far as I know) 
\end{DoxyItemize}
